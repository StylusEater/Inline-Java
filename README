INTRODUCTION:

Inline::Java - Write Perl classes in Java.

Inline::Java lets you write Perl classes in Java.

Example:

    use Inline Java => <<'END',
	    class JAxH {
			public JAxH(String x){
				System.out.println("Just Another " + x + " Hacker") ;
			}
	    }
	END
    
    new JAxH('Inline') ;

When run, this complete program prints:

    Just Another Inline Hacker

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JNI (JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE) EXTENSION:

When you do 'perl Makefile.PL', Makefile.PL will ask you if you want to 
build the JNI extension.

The JNI extension that allows you to load the Java virtual machine as a 
shared object instead of running it as a separate process. Building the JNI 
extension does not force you to use it, it simply gives you that option. 

To use it, you must use the USE_JNI config option or the 
PERL_INLINE_JAVA_USE_JNI environment variable.

The JNI extension has been built and tested on:
- Solaris 2.5.1
- Windows 2000
- Windows 95

Depending on your platform, the build is more or less complex:

MSWin32:
- Follow the instructions provided by Makefile.PL. Don't forget to add to
  your PATH the directory where jvm.dll is located.

Solaris:
- In order to get the JNI extension running on Solaris, you will 
  most probably need to recompile Perl. At the end of the Perl
  configuration, you will be asked if you want to edit the config.sh 
  file. Say 'yes' and look for the following lines:

    libs='...'
       Change this to:
         libs='-lthread ...'

    usemymalloc='...'
       Change this to:
         usemymalloc='n'

- Then finish building Perl as usual.
- Note: On my setup, 'make test' failed one test: pragma/warnings #179.
  But when I followed the instructions:
    ### Since most tests were successful, you have a good chance to
    ### get information with better granularity by running
    ###     ./perl harness 
    ### in directory ./t.
  all tests where successful.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

- This module requires Inline version 0.31 or higher to be installed.
- It also requires a version of the Java SDK 1.2 or higher to be 
  installed. You can get the latest Java SDK from Sun Microsystems
  at http://java.sun.com. Follow the provided instructions in order
  to install the Java SDK properly.

To install Inline::Java do this:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test (see Note 2, 3)
make install

You have to 'make install' before you can run it successfully. 


Note 1: Use nmake on Windows systems. If you are using the COMMAND.COM shell
under Windows, Inline::Java will try to detect it. If it doesn't, 
you should set the PERL_INLINE_JAVA_COMMAND_COM environment variable 
to a true value. You also will need set this whenever you use the module
later on.

Note 2: In order for 'make test' to run properly, you should put the 
directory to your Java binaries in either your PATH environment variable 
or in the PERL_INLINE_JAVA_BIN environment variable. 'make test' will remind you 
if you don't do this.

Note 3: If you have built the JNI extension and want the test suite to use 
it, set the PERL_INLINE_JAVA_USE_JNI environment variable to a true value
before running 'make test'.

FEATURES:

WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. It is incomplete and possibly unreliable. 
         It is also possible that some elements of the interface (API) will 
         change in future releases.

Inline::Java version 0.20 includes:
+ All public member variables are now exported to Perl.
+ Arrays can now be passed as method parameters and assigned to 
  member variables.
+ Type casting is now available to force the selection of specific
  method signatures.
+ Optional JNI (Java Native Interface) extension improves performance
  dramatically.

Inline::Java version 0.01 includes:
+ All classes and their public methods are exported to Perl, relative
  to your current package.
+ All objects (except arrays) and primitive Java types are supported as
  method parameters.
