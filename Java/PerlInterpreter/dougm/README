hi patrick,

i never got around to publishing the code.  i've attached the basics, 
which i haven't touched since march.  never got past the experimental 
stage.  the libPerlInterpreter.so is actually built using perl -x 
PerlInterpreter.c.  i think that's the toughest part, getting things to 
link properly on all platforms.  the code itself is pretty simple. just
skimmed it and noticed a few leaks, missing ReleaseString calls. there is
a little test invoked via PerlInterpreter.main()
you're welcome to use the attached code in Inline::Java.  i don't expect 
to have time to work on it, the code would be better off in your hands 
anyhow.  but i haven't lost interest and would be happy to try out any of 
your work in progress.
