CODE:
- Check INFO flag vs. PRINT_INFO (shortcuts not working?)
- Fix for Java 1.4 (reflection inverting method/member order)
- Improve documentation of issues:
- Include patch by Doug MacEachern


These tips should get you going:

 - Take note that in SHARED_JVM mode, System.out is closed(). This is
 necessary
   in order for the process to detach itself properly on certain platforms.
 Anyway only the
   processs that actually started the JVM could see the output. Maybe a log
 file would be a good
   idea... I'll think about that.

 - Try running it without SHARED_JVM first. It's a lot easier to debug. First
 you get System.out, second
   JVM restarts each time, so when you change your Java code you don't need
 to kill the JVM manually.
   Anyways I don't think in your case your need SHARED_JVM. SHARED_JVM is
 really meant to be used
   when your Perl script is a CGI/mod_perl module where you get many requests
 and you can't afford
   the JVM startup delay every time. It's also useful if you need to share
 data betwen each of your script
   invocations (if your use 'static' data in your Java class, all the script
 invocations can access the data and it's
   persistent between accesses).


 I'm taking note of these details and I'll beef up the documentation of these
 issues.
